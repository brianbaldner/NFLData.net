# NFL.Net

An API client to connect to various NFL data sources

## Services
* NFL.com `NFL.Com`
* ESPN Fantasy `NFL.ESPN.Fantasy`
* More coming soon

The NFL.com API is easy to use but requires authentication that expires every hour. The ESPN Fantasy API is very confusing and it is hard to get specific data. 

### Dependencies

Uses RestSharp and Newtonsoft.Json.
